# What is this?
This is a project I submitted for the 10th GameBoy Jam (https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-10).

Binaries are available on itch.io here: https://tleonarduk.itch.io/house-of-thyme-3d

This project is built for UE5 5.0.3

# Restrictions
The restriction of this jam were 4 colors, 160 x 144 resolution and the same number of inputs as the original gameboy.

# Caution
This was made in about 5 days. It's not representative of good practices, and shouldn't be used to learn anything. It's posted here just for curiosities sake.
